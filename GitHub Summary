Adding 2nd ReadMe file
On GitHub, saved changes are called commits. Each commit has an associated commit message, which is a description explaining why a particular change was made. Commit messages capture the history of your changes, so other contributors can understand what you’ve done and why.
These changes will be made to just the README file on your readme-edits branch, so now this branch contains content that’s different from master.
Now that you have changes in a branch off of master, you can open a pull request.
When you’re satisfied that these are the changes you want to submit, click the big green Create Pull Request button.
Final Step - Merge the pull request
Click the green Merge pull request button to merge the changes into master.
